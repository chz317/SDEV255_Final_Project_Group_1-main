# SDEV255_Final_Project_Group_1

To start assisting with the class project

git clone https://github.com/Kevincripe/SDEV255_Final_Project_Group_1.git

Request .env file from Discord cat

Run 'npm install' to install all project dependcy's
    Node_modules folder is .gitignored and will not be part of repo

Proper way to work would be
    git checkout -b NAMEOFYOURBRANCH

    once work is complete
    git add *
    git comment -m "commentgoeshere"
    git push
    git checkout main
    git merge NAMEOFYOURBRANCH

    this will generate a pull request for me to review and merge
