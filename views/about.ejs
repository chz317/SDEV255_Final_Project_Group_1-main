    <p> SDEV 255 Final Project - Intro and Requirements
      This is a document that outlines the final project for this course. This final project will be broken into two stages. Stage 1 will be completed during Module 5 and 6. Stage 2 will be completed during the final parts of Module 7 and 8. You will complete this assignment in your groups with your designated roles. This is the prompt for the final project:
      
        Create a web application that allows students sign- up for college courses, and for teachers/staff to add, delete, and edit courses.
      These are the two stages to this project:
      </p><br>
    <p>Create a list of courses, and teachers that can be created, viewed, edited, and deleted. Teachers will have the ability to add and delete these courses at will. At first any teacher can delete any other teachersâ€™ courses, but we will update it so that courses only created by the currently signed-in teacher can be deleted. There should be a couple of pages viewable during this stage of development

      At the end of Stage 1 the following should be completed:
      
      A place to add courses (or an index of courses with a button to add new courses
      An index/ webpage of all courses that have been created.
      The website links active, and partially designed
      The ability to view an individual course
      </p><br>
    <p>Students should be able to navigate and search out classes either based on the course name or number. Students should have the ability to sign in, sign out, and register users. The students should be able to add the classes to their own schedule so that they know which classes they are taking. They should also be able to view a screen with all of the classes they are currently signed up for. The students should also be able to delete or drop a class. 

      At the end of Stage 2 the following should be completed:
      A login system should be implemented
      Authorization should be differentiated between student and teachers
      Students should be able to add courses to their schedule
      Students should be able to drop courses from their schedule
